        <h1>Forecasting TSA Data with R</h1>
            <p><i>2024-09-27</i></p>
            
            <p>If we want to create a forecast in R for the TSA Passenger data to predict passenger volumes in the future, we can use the <a href="https://tidyverts.org">tidyverts packages</a> `fable`, `tsibble`, and `feasts`.</p>

            <p>These packages apply <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">tidy data principles</a> to time series data and forecasting. They were coauthored by the forecasting great <a href="https://robjhyndman.com">Rob Hyndman</a>, and his fantastic textbook <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/">Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd Edition)</a> uses these packages and workflows.</p>
            
            <h2>Plotting and Decomposing the History</h2>
                <p>The historical TSA Passenger data that we have looks like this:</p>

                <p>There is clear seasonality throughout history, and there has been an upward trend coming out of the Covid downturn.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating Models with a Traditional Train/Test Split</h2>
                <p>The <code>fable</code> package provides several time series models to choose from. We can evaluate which perform the best by breaking out data into separate train/test sets.</p>
